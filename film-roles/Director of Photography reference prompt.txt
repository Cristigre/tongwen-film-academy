Please create an engaging HTML-based educational page designed for beginner filmmakers, introducing the role of the Director of Photography (also known as DP or Cinematographer).

The goal is to explain the creative and technical responsibilities of the DP, focusing on visual storytelling, collaboration, and leadership — with examples and interactive elements.
